# Sprint 1

### Date: 2023-02-08

## User stories

- As a Spotify user, I want to be able to log in by using my Spotify
- As a party host, I want to be able to create a playlist for my party
- As a party goer and music lover, I want to be able to create a playlist with my friends

- Sasha wants to be able to make playlist with her friends
- As a karaoke host, I want to be able to create a playlist for my karaoke party
- John wants to sign in with his spotify account

## What issues your team planned to address

- Create a stylzed UI for the app
- Create a login page
- Add user information to the database
- Connect to firestore database & spotify API
- Create playlist functionality

## Which ones were successfully completed

- We have a login page only for spotify users
- We connected to the spotify API and were able to get the user's playlists and songs
- We have functionality for users to connect with other users through Spotify and add them to their friends list
- We created a simple UI for the web app
- created collections in the firestore database for groups, users, and songs

## Which ones didn't and why?

- Login page does not integrate with the backend fully and need to fix collections in the database
- We were not able to create a playlist for the user and add songs to it because did not have time to implement the functionality
- We did not have enough time to style the UI as much as we would have liked and will need to allocate more time in future sprints to improve the aesthetics of the app
