Project name: VibeShare

Project description:
This project is a social media application that allows people to collaborate on Spotify playlists, comment, share, etc. Our project will also generate song suggestions for the combined playlist. Specific features that the project would implement include developing group-centered playlists for events, voting songs or group playlists, etc. These features would increase the enjoyment level for a party due to the playlist being designed based on environment and user similarities.
